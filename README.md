The paper deals with the effectiveness of the unconventional monetary policy applied by the Federal Reserve in the period 2008-2016 - in particular, the strength of its impact on the US economy and financial markets. The following sections describe the theoretical underpinnings of unconventional monetary policy, the research literature on the issue and the own study aimed at verifying the most important hypotheses. The main research tools used in this paper are the Svensson model and the vector autoregression model (VAR), estimated on monthly data from 2008 to 2016. The most important conclusions are: significant impact of unconventional monetary policy on the growth of indices on U.S. stock markets and on the growth of U.S. Treasury bond yields.
